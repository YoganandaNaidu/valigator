## Valigator: Stand-alone PHP Class for Data Sanitization and Validation
Lovers of minimalism, rejoice! Valigator is a stand-alone PHP class for data sanitization and validation. It has no library dependencies, implements programmer-friendly filter syntax, and is highly flexible. Its just one single class file, include it and you are already on the move!

## Valigator, huh?
PHP API frameworks are picking up, and fast. They are wonderfully minimalist, speedy, and vastly preferred over powerful yet sometimes clunky larger frameworks. To implement validations in API frameworks and projects, large vendor sources have to be installed, adding unnecessary additions to code-base and complexity. Valigator was created to address specifically that. And there's nothing that stops you from using Valigator in non-API projects. Go ahead, you'll love it!

**Valigator Checklist:** ✓ PHP (5.5.\*, 5.6.\*, 7.\*) ✓ Simple ✓ Flexible ✓ Stand-alone ✓
Programmer-friendly ✓ Data Sanitization ✓ Data Validation

PS: Slim Framework 3 is groovy!

## Yet Another Vali[dg]ator
Maybe. Maybe not. Yeah, Valigator draws inspiration from some of the good, nay, great ones. And adds its own good bits too. Just to get you interested: Filter Aliasing, Multiple Arguments, Programmer-customizable Validation Error Messages and more.
